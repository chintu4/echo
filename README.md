 Frontend Developer Intern

About the Assignment
We are seeking Frontend Developer Interns (preferably 4th year students or recent graduates) who can build modern, scalable, and secure web applications. This project will test not only your frontend engineering skills but also your ability to integrate with a basic backend you create yourself.

Assignment Overview
You will build a Scalable Web App with Authentication & Dashboard, including a basic backend to facilitate API requests, within 3 days.

Core Features to Implement
✅ Frontend (Primary Focus)
Build with React.js or Next.js


Responsive design using TailwindCSS / Material UI / Bootstrap


Forms with validation (client + server side)

✅ Basic Backend (Supportive)
Implement a lightweight backend using Node.js/Express or Python (FastAPI/Django)


Create APIs for:


User signup/login (JWT-based authentication)


Profile fetching/updating


CRUD operations on a sample entity (e.g., tasks, notes, or posts)


Connect backend to a database (MongoDB/Postgres/MySQL)


✅ Dashboard Features
Display user profile (fetched from backend)


CRUD operations on the sample entity

Logout flow


✅ Security & Scalability
Password hashing (bcrypt or similar)


JWT authentication middleware


Error handling & validation


Code structured for easy scaling



Deliverables

Dashboard with CRUD-enabled entity


Postman collection or API docs


Note on how you would scale the frontend-backend integration for production
